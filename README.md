## Introduction

This project is part of my data science internship at Prodigy Company. The task focuses on analyzing data and visualizing trends over the years for different categories.

## Installation

To run the notebook and perform the analysis, you need to install the following Python libraries:

- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn

You can install these libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
```

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains various data points for analysis.

Source: Kaggle
File: data_file.csv
Description: The dataset includes data points for different categories over a specified period. It contains columns like Column1, Column2, Column3, and yearly values.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
The notebook includes steps to load and explore the dataset. 

Key steps include:

Loading the dataset using pandas.
Displaying the first few rows to understand its structure.
Cleaning and preprocessing the data.

## Visualizations

Several visualizations are created to analyze the trends:

Line plots showing the trends over time.
Bar charts comparing different categories.
Heatmaps to visualize the distribution across different years.

## Code and Analysis
Below is an excerpt of the code used for analysis and visualizations:
```bash
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

file = 'path_to_data_file.csv'
df = pd.read_csv(file, encoding='ISO-8859-1')

# Display the first few rows of the dataframe
print(df.head())

# Basic statistics of the dataset
print(df.describe())

# Example visualization
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
sns.lineplot(data=df, x='Year', y='Value', hue='Category')
plt.xlabel('Year')
plt.ylabel('Value')
plt.title('Trend Over Time')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```
## Conclusion
The analysis provides insights into how the data has changed over the years for various categories. The visualizations help in understanding the trends and identifying significant patterns.
